# Contributor Blog #10: Interview with Divya Mohan


We have many diverse contributors in opensource that help upstream communities in unconventional ways, which doesn’t require any coding or development skills. Starting with a non-code contribution can help anyone overcome the sense of failure and not being good enough, and it can also serve as a springboard for our open source adventure. This interview series aims to highlight some non-code open source contributions that anyone can make right now to get started contributing.

For this month’s edition, we talked about creating a career out of opensource contributions and becoming a community manager  with Divya Mohan.


<br/>

**Can you introduce yourself and share your journey so far?**
<br/>
	
Hi there, my name is Divya Mohan. I work as a Senior Technical Evangelist with SUSE and an advisor to Avesha. I graduated in electronics engineering and started working in an IT company because there were no electronics companies that came to my college. My plan was to switch to embedded electronics at my first company, which had an embedded electronics division. I chose that company for that specific purpose, but then I became interested in systems engineering and understanding how systems work in general.

Although I'm not a software or developer professional and don't have a coding or computer science background, I'm still learning about coding, but systems engineering is where my true interest lies. I gained a lot of knowledge about Linux and how everything works in an application, holistically, because of my experience in systems engineering. Then I moved from Capgemini to HSBC and transitioned to a people manager role where I managed a team of 11 people. When the pandemic hit, I was transitioning and became interested in Kubernetes because it was being onboarded. I started reading the documentation and realized that I could contribute to the project and understand how it made decisions about which features to include in a release. 

As someone who had worked on proprietary products for most of my career, this was an interesting opportunity for me. I started finding ways to contribute to Kubernetes documentation, which eventually led me to become one of the maintainers of the project. I saw that CNCF Ambassador was something I could apply for and become a part of. After mentioning my contributions to the ecosystem, I was able to become a CNCF Ambassador seven to eight months after I started contributing. As of now, I'm one of the documentation maintainers for the Kubernetes & LitmusChaos projects and a CNCF ambassador.


<br/>

**Were all of your contributions focused on a single project within the CNCF landscape?**
<br/>

Not all of my projects were related to CNCF, although most of them were. I was heavily involved with both LitmusChaos and Kubernetes, and eventually became one of the documentation maintainers for LitmusChaos. In addition, I worked with the Kubernetes release team and did documentation edits on the side. However, I also participated in Google Season of Docs during the same year, which was outside of the CNCF ecosystem. I interned with CERN and worked on the documentation for their large hydrogen collider’s data management system. While I'm sure CNCF did not take this into consideration during my application to become an ambassador, it did help me learn a lot more about technical writing in general.


<br/>

**Did you contribute to any other projects along with Kubernetes and LitmusChaos?**
<br/>
	
The projects I am currently associated with are Kubernetes and LitmusChaos, in addition to the projects I work with as part of my job at SUSE. Since SUSE is an open-source company, the list of projects I am involved with could be quite long. I am also an advisor to Avesha, which has an open-source project called Kubeslice. I work on that project as well as Rancher and all of those projects that SUSE has outside of work. In Kubernetes and LitmusChaos, I have major named roles, and I am one of the documentation maintainers. With Kubeslice, I am not a maintainer, but I advise on how to build a community and improve the contributor experience. Although I don't have a specific named role in Kubeslice, I contribute significantly to Kubernetes and LitmusChaos.


<br/>

**How did your contribution journey start?**
<br/>

I started my journey with a minor edit that involved fixing the date field for the Kubernetes documentation. To be honest, I did not know a lot about GitHub before. In my job as a systems engineer, we didn't use it much. However, I realized that I needed to start using GitHub. I learned about GitHub thanks to Kubernetes, and I credit the project every day. Before that, I didn't know anything about GitHub or Version Control. I learned a lot on the go, and my first contribution was to add a date field to the documentation so that we could track when it was last edited and published. I had no idea how to do anything because I had not worked with the static site generator they used. I faced many stumbling blocks, but Tim Bannister, who was a tech lead then, advised me and helped me out. Community members also stepped up to help, and I gained confidence and started making more contributions. Essentially, the first pull request took a lot of time for me to figure out because I was new to GitHub and the concept of a pull request.


<br/>

**I understand and can totally relate to your experience. I assume that you have your own website, so the fact that you were not aware of what a static site generator is and then went on to create your own website is a full circle in terms of your learning.**
<br/>

The first time I learned about GitHub Pages was when I started learning about all of this.
I did not know that there was a thing called GitHub Pages where you could actually host your website. Then I learned about static site generators and documentation systems. My mind was blown for a really long time because all the documentation I had encountered before were in the form of Word documents on SharePoint sites or Confluence. Typically, enterprises don't have documentation management systems, we just either have SharePoint or Confluence. So this blew my mind, and I guess the rest is history.


<br/>

**In what ways have you contributed?**
<br/>

As aforementioned, I started my journey by helping with the Kubernetes documentation. One fun fact is that I actually landed my current job & the subsequent transition because of my open source contributions. But over and above that, till last year I was heavily involved with the Kubernetes releases and led the Communications vertical for one cycle. As a CNCF ambassador, I also get the opportunity to interact with communities via events & help make cloud native & open source better. So that's another cool way. Code is a great way to get involved too but given my background, it's just something I started getting into professionally fairly recently.


I think that's basically the long and short of it. So, basically, I haven't contributed a lot of code, and most of my contributions have been in documentation and program management. All the release work I did involved a lot of coordination between different teams within the Kubernetes project. That involves a lot of interpersonal capabilities, rather than the ability to write code like those people would actually wrote the code, but you have to ensure that it passes the necessary checks. Every team has different responsibilities, and you have to ensure that all of them are done. Documentation has to be in place, blogs have to get into the system, and there's a lot of moving parts involved in a release. The release team that we see on social media is actually doing a lot of program/project management work, and it requires a lot of coordination, as opposed to coding skills. That's what I did, and it helped me learn new skills for my new job, as I was a newly minted manager at that time. It also helped me build skills for my other job at HSBC. I took both those experiences and became the maintainer, which is great.

<br/>


**Can you talk about some of the challenges you might have faced?**
<br/>

Unlike a lot of the contributors who start with open source pretty early on in their careers, I began my journey as a fairly experienced person. It's a double-edged sword because on the one hand while I had a solid foundation on account of the experience, it was difficult for me to switch contexts initially because I was steeped & comfortable in my ways. So one of the challenges was, of course, the getting-used-to phase initially since open source was very different from anything I had experienced thus far. Although my previous employer was supportive of my involvement, the work was only to be done outside of office hours. That was a challenging phase and quickly spiraled into burnout because I didn't pace myself well. Infact, I even spoke about that experience earlier this year in [my talk](https://youtu.be/UIU8qZWL3Io) at KubeCon EU.

<br/>

**Share your experience in becoming a contributor.**
<br/>

One of the real reasons behind me becoming a contributor was to understand Kubernetes better. It wasn't a straight road and I'm still learning new things everyday, but I can confirm that it really does take a whole village! Whether it be my mentors, official and unofficial, or friends I made along the way, every single person I've interacted with has been instrumental in shaping the experience I've had so far. Especially when I was new to the ecosystem, the warm welcome I was given helped me gain confidence & steer my course. For me, open source opened up a lot of horizons. It opened up an entire new ecosystem for me to learn from, and I did not have that opportunity before. When I started out, I was working on proprietary software, and all of the work I was doing was behind closed doors. I could say on my resume that I have worked on XYZ stuff and helped cost savings, but I didn't have actual proof. With open source, I feel like it's easier for me to learn because there's a constant feedback loop. Secondly, the thing about open source is, like I said, documenting whatever you're working on in public so people can see that I'm contributing. You just have to look at my GitHub or if you're looking for more content around courses or maybe videos or articles or written stuff, you can just find it on the internet where I've done things. Previously, it was not the case and it was different. Being in the ecosystem itself is huge because I get to learn from people I probably would not have interacted with before. Right now, I can at least say that I'm a little more knowledgeable, if not on top of things or on top of the developments in our industry, at least a little more knowledgeable than when I started out in the industry. It helps to work alongside people who are extremely smart or extremely talented, and it pushes you to be better. For that I'll be ever thankful. 

<br/>

**How do I get started with contributing your way?**
<br/>

Like I said, it all started because I was curious and wanted to do my job better. Those were my motivations. Having an open mind gave me the opportunity to diversify and try out as many things as I wanted along the way. If you're looking to start, that's where I'd recommend you begin. 

There is no specific path or set way to approach open source. Open source is a vast ecosystem with numerous avenues to explore. Even if you start with documentation, you may end up in a completely different area. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend following my way. Open source provides a unique opportunity to learn and explore. Unlike a traditional nine-to-five job, it allows you to learn beyond specific topics. Open source is not only limited to cloud-native; there are numerous other areas where you can get involved. Anyone who knows GitHub or any version control can explore and check out the source code. Initially, there may be some barriers, but the information is available on the internet, and with some effort, one can figure it out. That's the beauty of open source.

<br/>

**Recommend one unconventional contributor whom you admire and tell us more about them.**
<br/>

That's very difficult because no two journeys are the same, right? But if it had to be just one, I'd go with Savitha Raghunathan who was the one to pick me to shadow her on the documentation for a Kubernetes release. Unconventional because even though she had a traditional CS background, the way she found herself in the Kubernetes community was by means of the work she did at her previous employer, Mathworks. She got interested & started participating outside of her work hours because open source work wasn't really supported as a part of her day job. Following her lead (very literally) was what helped me because I was in a similar situation at my previous day job. Even though we gave a talk about burning out & overcommitting, I genuinely think she is the one amongst the both of us who is able to set boundaries more efficiently.

<br/>
<br/>

Divya, I appreciate you so much for taking the time to share your experience and viewpoint on open source contributions. I have learned lots of things from our conversation, and I hope that it will be helpful to our readers. Thank you so much!

I will leave you all with my favorite takeaway from this interview..

###### A contributor is only a contributor when they can bring in other contributors to contribute to the project.

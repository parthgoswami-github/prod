# Contributor Blog #2: Passive listener → Active contributor


We have many diverse contributors in opensource that help upstream communities in unconventional ways which doesn't require any coding or development skills. Starting with a non-code contribution can help anyone overcome the sense of failure and not being good enough, and it can also serve as a springboard for our open source adventure. This article aims to highlight some non-code open source contributions that anyone can make right now to get started contributing.

For this month’s edition, we talked about the Mozilla, Wikipedia and Fedora with Priyanka Pandey.

**Can you tell us some background about you, what your journey has been at Red Hat, and what you do today?**
<br/>

I was introduced to the world of Open Source back in my college days. My first Open Source contribution was translating Firefox strings from English to my native language, Bengali. During the span of my college life, I had the opportunity of volunteering with a few different communities and meeting some very interesting and inspiring people from the Open Source world. It was during a few of these interactions that I happened to meet some Red Hatters, who were extremely passionate about Open Source. 
Red Hat, a for-profit organization, who was generating revenue year-on-year and still contained the soul of Open Source at its heart; it was rare and impressive. Right from then, Red Hat became my dream! The tiny adult that I was back then, started aspiring to be a Red Hatter. The dream turned into reality soon when I noticed an opening for a Technical Writer position at the Red Hat Pune office, back in 2015. I joined Red Hat as an Associate Technical Writer. Before joining Red Hat as an employee, I had visited the Red Hat office a couple of times for different community events. Whenever a visitor accesses any of the Red Hat office premises, they are given a temporary visitor pass. My friends still tease me saying that I was using so many of those temporary passes that the organization got tired and decided to give me a permanent employee id card. Well, I am definitely not complaining :P

Achieving the dream was only the start of a beautiful journey, a journey that is still ongoing. For the initial four years at Red Hat, I did write technical documents for the middleware product line of Red Hat, mainly EAP. As a writer, we were seated along with the technical support engineers of the product and would be collaborating with them very heavily to understand customer requirements. During these collaborations, I realized that the opportunity to directly interact with customers everyday, to be able to help resolve their technical issues…it had a different level of work satisfaction. When I shared my thoughts with my writing team’s manager, I was surprised to see the level of support and mentoring that he provided which helped me land an internal opening within the Technical Support team of Red Hat. In 2019, I took up the role of a Technical Lead (aka, Support Operations Lead) within the RHEL support team. From there began another phase of the journey. Being on our toes for all days, 24x7; handling customer escalation; firefighting difficult customer crisis situations…the more challenges that came in, the more my enthusiasm and energy grew. In Jule of 2020, I became an Associate Manager within the RHEL support team and exactly 2 years later and around 15 days back, I got promoted to be a Manager for the same team now. 

<br/>

**What product(s) have you contributed to so far?** 
<br/>

- If I talk about my open source contributions, I was mostly involved with the Mozilla community. From translating Firefox strings to fixing simpler coding bugs; from evangelizing Mozilla products at different forums to writing documents for the Mozilla Developer Network; I have done a lot of different things. 
- Other than Mozilla, I have contributed slightly to Wikimedia Foundation. I have even done an internship with Wikimedia under OPW (what is now known as Outreachy) - https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Priyanka_Nag/OPW
- I have worked a little with the Drupal community and Fedora community as well. 
- I had been a keynote speaker at the Joomla World Conference 2015, in Bangalore - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhI3LlYjesg

<br/>

**How did your contribution journey start?**
<br/>
 
I was in my final year of graduation at Symbiosis Institute of Computer Studies and Research when one day, I noticed a poster for a Mozilla meetup that was happening at our college the coming Saturday. Well, I had no clue what Mozilla was back then…I just identified the Firefox logo on the poster and that raised my curiosity. Who comes to college on Saturday or a meetup? Why would anyone want to work over the weekend…that too when they are not getting paid? With all these thoughts, I moved to my class. When Saturday arrived, I couldn’t hold myself from wanting to learn more about what meetups are. I won’t lie by saying that I became convinced with all the ideologies that were being spoken about in that room in just a day and became an open source contributor right away. Of Course not. But one thing that definitely happened during that meet was the energy that was present in that room during that meet, the passion that everyone in the room held…that infected me sufficiently that I got convinced to attend the followup meetups. In no time, from being a passive listener, I became an active contributor. A decade since then, and the core value of Open Source is still my driving energy today. 

<br/>

**Can you talk about some of the challenges you might have faced?**
<br/>

No journey can be always scenic and smooth…there will always be some bumps on the road. When I started back in 2012, there weren’t too many female contributors in Open Source. Walking into a conference where you are the only representative of your gender wasn’t always super comfortable. We used to get both extreme reactions - people wondering why there is a woman in a tech conference…did she choose the wrong door while coming in and so on. And then there were times when people would suddenly start applauding you for just walking into the room…saying that you are very brave to come to a tech conference. Both of these reactions were ofcourse not desirable and took some time and effort to overcome. In a world which had very few women, now when I started climbing the community leadership ladder in the Mozilla community, ofcourse some people did oppose the idea of needing to follow a woman. Today when I look back, I think all of these experiences added a lot to my personal growth. 

<br/>

**Share your experience in becoming a contributor.**
<br/>

At college, rarely do we get the opportunity of working on live projects…working with people who are established names in the industry…working with people from across the globe. All of these and more become possible through open source contributions. It was because of my Mozilla contributions that I got the opportunity to visit a lot of meetups and conferences globally. Getting the exposure and experience of working with people of different cultures, visiting different countries in our twenties…that helps mold our character and personality in big ways. I still believe that I had landed my technical writing job at Red Hat because of my community contributions. Otherwise, Red Hat doesn’t really hire a lot of freshers directly into a full-time role. 

<br/>

**Why should one contribute to the Mozilla community?**
<br/>
 
Not talking about any specific project or product, but if anyone ever asks me why they should contribute to open source and communities in general, the answer is pretty simple. If no one writes those wikipedia articles which we all use everyday for our work, education and other purposes…those contents will not exist. The world wide web can’t only be consumed; we need to give back to our share as well. As a Red Hatter, I do believe that open makes the world better.

<br/>

**How do I get started with contributing your way?** 
<br/>

The open source community has been working towards making it easy for any new contributor to get started with their first contributions. There are a lot of sites like:

- **Mozilla** | https://whatcanidoformozilla.org/
- **Fedora**  | https://whatcanidoforfedora.org/
- **First Timers Only** | https://www.firsttimersonly.com/
- **Open Source Friday** | https://opensourcefriday.com/
- **24 P[ULL]** R[EQUEST]S  | https://24pullrequests.com/

These are just some of the many many options available online for any new contributor to begin their open source journey.

<br/>

Recommend one unconventional contributor whom you admire and tell us more about them. 
Oh, I have always been a huge fan of Christian Heilmann. I had the fortune of meeting Christian a couple of times when he was working with Mozilla. Rarely do we get to see orators and presenters like Christian, who when on stage can mesmerize the entire audience with their presence. Whenever someone compliments my presentation skills today, I silently pass on a thank you to Christian. I am the Eklavya who has been silently following my Dronacharya Christian for years ;)


<br/>

I'd like to thank Priyanka for her time and an enlighting conversation. I will leave you all with my favorite takeaway from this interview..

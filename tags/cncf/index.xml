Starting with a non-code contribution can help anyone overcome the sense of failure and not being good enough, and it can also serve as a springboard for our open source adventure.

            </div>KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Barcelona, Spain (from 20 to 23rd May 2019) was my first international conference invite. KubeCon is kind of a conference where you will meet all cloud-native enthusiasts, researchers, engineers and everyone working to build cloud-native applications easier. I applied for a Diversity Scholarship and fortunately, I was amongst the 56 people selected to be a part of KubeCon 2019 at Barcelona.
In KubeCon, you get to be a part of Keynotes, breakout sessions and get to attend co-located workshops, panel discussions and many more events.]]></description>

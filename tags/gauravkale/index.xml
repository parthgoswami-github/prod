    <description><![CDATA[In the image below, we can see the names of every part in an URL.

Because of this, the Domain Name System—or more precisely, the Phone Directory for IP Addresses—was introduced. However, due to the memory limitations of the human brain, we are unable to recall all of these billions of IP addresses. In order to make it easier to remember names, we began referring to these IP addresses by names, which are simply the website names that we type into the address bar of a browser.]]></description>

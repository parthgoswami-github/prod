- Openshift focuses on managing applications and not containers. As Kubernetes falls under Container as a Service (CAAS) which helps in managing containers and Openshift helps in managing applications. 

- Openshift runs above Kubernetes as we deploy applications into containers.

- As Openshift helps in developing, deploying and managing container based application, it also provides self-service platform to create, modify and deploy applications on demand, enabling faster development. 


## OSD (Openshift Dedicated):

## ROSA (Redhat Openshift on AWS):

- OpenShift is Red Hat's Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that allows developers to quickly develop, host, and scale applications in a cloud environment.

- Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) delivers production-ready Kubernetes that many enterprises currently use on-premises today, enhancing the ability for customers to shift workloads to the cloud and making it even easier for customers to adopt containers and deploy their applications faster on AWS.
